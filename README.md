Autors: Farshad Ahmadi Asl, Mehmet Bodur

Three different well developed forecasting models are constracted (BRNN, SVR, Fuzzy SBC). They are tested and compared together in three different time terms (Very Short, Short, Medium) to reveal their weaknesses and strengths. Additionally, their processing time are measured. Honda Smart Home US dataset chose as a case study for this work.
